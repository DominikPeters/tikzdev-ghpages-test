      // number is auto-incremented by MathJax between equations.

          </h4>
          <a id="pgfmanual-autopage-380"></a>
          <a id="pgfmanual-autofile-8"></a>

          <p>
            The present section is not about <span class="textsc">pgf</span> or
            <span class="tikzname">TikZ</span>, but about general guidelines and
            principles concerning the creation of graphics for scientific
            presentations, papers, and books.
          </p>

          <p>
            The guidelines in this section come from different sources. Many of
            them are just what I would like to claim is &ldquo;common
            sense&rdquo;, some reflect my personal experience (though,
            hopefully, not my personal preferences), some come from books (the
            bibliography is still missing, sorry) on graphic design and
            typography. The most influential source are the brilliant books by
            Edward Tufte. While I do not agree with everything written in these
            books, many of Tufte&rsquo;s arguments are so convincing that I
            decided to repeat them in the following guidelines.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first thing you should ask yourself when someone presents a
            bunch of guidelines is: Should I really follow these guidelines?
            This is an important question, because there are good reasons not to
            follow general guidelines. The person who set up the guidelines may
            have had other objectives than you do. For example, a guideline
            might say &ldquo;use the color red for emphasis&rdquo;. While this
            guideline makes perfect sense for, say, a presentation using a
            projector, red &ldquo;color&rdquo; has the <em>opposite</em> effect
            of &ldquo;emphasis&rdquo; when printed using a black-and-white
            printer. Guidelines were almost always set up to address a specific
            situation. If you are not in this situation, following a guideline
            can do more harm than good.
          </p>

          <p>
            The second thing you should be aware of is the basic rule of
            typography is: &ldquo;Every rule can be broken, as long as you are
            <em>aware</em> that you are breaking a rule.&rdquo; This rule also
            applies to graphics. Phrased differently, the basic rule states:
            &ldquo;The only mistakes in typography are things done in
            ignorance.&rdquo; When you are aware of a rule and when you decide
            that breaking the rule has a desirable effect, break the rule.
          </p>

            the Time Needed for the Creation of Graphics<a

              href="#sec-7.1"
              >&para;</a
            >
          </h5>
          <a id="pgfmanual-autopage-382"></a>

          <p>
            When you create a paper with numerous graphics, the time needed to
            create these graphics becomes an important factor. How much time
            should you calculate for the creation of graphics?
          </p>

          <p>
            As a general rule, assume that a graphic will need as much time to
            create as would a text of the same length. For example, when I write
            a paper, I need about one hour per page for the first draft. Later,
            I need between two and four hours per page for revisions. Thus, I
            expect to need about half an hour for the creation of
            <em>a first draft</em> of a half page graphic. Later on, I expect
            another one to two hours before the final graphic is finished.
          </p>

          <p>
            In many publications, even in good journals, the authors and editors
            have obviously invested a lot of time on the text, but seem to have
            spend about five minutes to create all of the graphics. Graphics
            often seem to have been added as an &ldquo;afterthought&rdquo; or
            look like a screen shot of whatever the authors&rsquo;s statistical
            software shows them. As will be argued later on, the graphics that
            programs like <span class="textsc">gnuplot</span> produce by default
            are of poor quality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Creating informative graphics that help the reader and that fit
            together with the main text is a difficult, lengthy process.

                &bull; Treat graphics as first-class citizens of your papers.
                They deserve as much time and energy as the text does. Indeed,
                the creation of graphics might deserve <em>even more</em> time
                than the writing of the main text since more attention will be
                paid to the graphics and they will be looked at first.

          <p>
            When you write a (scientific) paper, you will most likely follow the
            following pattern: You have some results/ideas that you would like
            to report about. The creation of the paper will typically start with
            compiling a rough outline. Then, the different sections are filled
            with text to create a first draft. This draft is then revised
            repeatedly until, often after substantial revision, a final paper
            results. In a good journal paper there is typically not be a single
            sentence that has survived unmodified from the first draft.
          </p>

          <p>Creating a graphics follows the same pattern:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Decide on what the graphic should communicate. Make this
                a conscious decision, that is, determine &ldquo;What is the
                graphic supposed to tell the reader?&rdquo;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Create an &ldquo;outline&rdquo;, that is, the rough
                overall &ldquo;shape&rdquo; of the graphic, containing the most
                crucial elements. Often, it is useful to do this using pencil
                and paper.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Fill out the finer details of the graphic to create a
                first draft.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Revise the graphic repeatedly along with the rest of the
                paper.

          <p>
            Graphics can be placed at different places in a text. Either, they
            can be inlined, meaning they are somewhere &ldquo;in the middle of
            the text&rdquo; or they can be placed in stand-alone
            &ldquo;figures&rdquo;. Since printers (the people) like to have
            their pages &ldquo;filled&rdquo;, (both for aesthetic and economic
            reasons) stand-alone figures may traditionally be placed on pages in
            the document far away from the main text that refers to them.
            <span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >L<span class="latexlogosup">a</span>T<span class="latexlogosub"
                  >e</span
                >X</span
              ></span
            >
            and
            <span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
              ></span
            >
            tend to encourage this &ldquo;drifting away&rdquo; of graphics for
            technical reasons.
          </p>

          <p>
            When a graphic is inlined, it will more or less automatically be
            linked with the main text in the sense that the labels of the
            graphic will be implicitly explained by the surrounding text. Also,
            the main text will typically make it clear what the graphic is about
            and what is shown.
          </p>

          <p>
            Quite differently, a stand-alone figure will often be viewed at a
            time when the main text that this graphic belongs to either has not
            yet been read or has been read some time ago. For this reason, you
            should follow the following guidelines when creating stand-alone
            figures:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Stand-alone figures should have a caption than should
                make them &ldquo;understandable by themselves&rdquo;.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, suppose a graphic shows an example of the different
                stages of a quicksort algorithm. Then the figure&rsquo;s caption
                should, at the very least, inform the reader that &ldquo;the
                figure shows the different stages of the quicksort algorithm
                introduced on page xyz&rdquo;. and not just &ldquo;Quicksort
                algorithm&rdquo;.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; A good caption adds as much context information as
                possible. For example, you could say: &ldquo;The figure shows
                the different stages of the quicksort algorithm introduced on
                page xyz. In the first line, the pivot element 5 is chosen. This
                causes&hellip;&rdquo; While this information can also be given
                in the main text, putting it in the caption will ensure that the
                context is kept. Do not feel afraid of a 5-line caption. (Your
                editor may hate you for this. Consider hating them back.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Reference the graphic in your main text as in &ldquo;for
                an example of quicksort &lsquo;in action&rsquo;, see
                Figure&nbsp;2.1 on page xyz&rdquo;.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Most books on style and typography recommend that you do
                not use abbreviations as in &ldquo;Fig.&nbsp;2.1&rdquo; but
                write &ldquo;Figure&nbsp;2.1&rdquo;.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main argument against abbreviations is that &ldquo;a period
                is too valuable to waste it on an abbreviation&rdquo;. The idea
                is that a period will make the reader assume that the sentence
                ends after &ldquo;Fig&rdquo; and it takes a &ldquo;conscious
                backtracking&rdquo; to realize that the sentence did not end
                after all.
              </p>
              <p>
                The argument in favor of abbreviations is that they save space.
              </p>
              <p>
                Personally, I am not really convinced by either argument. On the
                one hand, I have not yet seen any hard evidence that
                abbreviations slow readers down. On the other hand, abbreviating
                all &ldquo;Figure&rdquo; by &ldquo;Fig.&rdquo; is most unlikely
                to save even a single line in most documents. I avoid
                abbreviations.

          <p>
            Perhaps the most common &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; people do when
            creating graphics (remember that a &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; in design
            is always just &ldquo;ignorance&rdquo;) is to have a mismatch
            between the way their graphics look and the way their text looks.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is quite common that authors use several different programs for
            creating the graphics of a paper. An author might produce some plots
            using <span class="textsc">gnuplot</span>, a diagram using
            <span class="textsc">xfig</span>, and include an
            <span class="texttt">.eps</span> graphic a coauthor contributed
            using some unknown program. All these graphics will, most likely,
            use different line widths, different fonts, and have different
            sizes. In addition, authors often use options like
            <span class="texttt">[height=5cm]</span> when including graphics to
            scale them to some &ldquo;nice size&rdquo;.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the same approach were taken to writing the main text, every
            section would be written in a different font at a different size. In
            some sections all theorems would be underlined, in another they
            would be printed all in uppercase letters, and in another in red. In
            addition, the margins would be different on each page. Readers and
            editors would not tolerate a text if it were written in this
            fashion, but with graphics they often have to.
          </p>

          <p>
            To create consistency between graphics and text, stick to the
            following guidelines:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>&bull; Do not scale graphics.</p>
              <p>
                This means that when generating graphics using an external
                program, create them &ldquo;at the right size&rdquo;.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Use the same font(s) both in graphics and the body text.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>&bull; Use the same line width in text and graphics.</p>
              <p>
                The &ldquo;line width&rdquo; for normal text is the width of the
                stem of letters like T. For
                <span class="latexlogofont"
                  ><span class="latexlogo"
                    >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
                  ></span
                >, this is usually \(0.4\,\mathrm {pt}\). However, some journals
                will not accept graphics with a normal line width below
                \(0.5\,\mathrm {pt}\).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; When using colors, use a consistent color coding in the
                text and in graphics. For example, if red is supposed to alert
                the reader to something in the main text, use red also in
                graphics for important parts of the graphic. If blue is used for
                structural elements like headlines and section titles, use blue
                also for structural elements of your graphic.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, graphics may also use a logical intrinsic color coding.
                For example, no matter what colors you normally use, readers
                will generally assume, say, that the color green as
                &ldquo;positive, go, ok&rdquo; and red as &ldquo;alert, warning,
                action&rdquo;.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Creating consistency when using different graphic programs is almost
            impossible. For this reason, you should consider sticking to a
            single graphics program.
          </p>

            <span class="sectionnumber" id="sec-7.5">7.5&emsp;</span>Labels in
            Graphics<a class="anchor-link" href="#sec-7.5">&para;</a>
          </h5>
          <a id="pgfmanual-autopage-386"></a>

          <p>
            Almost all graphics will contain labels, that is, pieces of text
            that explain parts of the graphics. When placing labels, stick to
            the following guidelines:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Follow the rule of consistency when placing labels. You
                should do so in two ways: First, be consistent with the main
                text, that is, use the same font as the main text also for
                labels. Second, be consistent between labels, that is, if you
                format some labels in some particular way, format all labels in
                this way.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; In addition to using the same fonts in text and graphics,
                you should also use the same notation. For example, if you write
                \(1/2\) in your main text, also use &ldquo;\(1/2\)&rdquo; as
                labels in graphics, not &ldquo;0.5&rdquo;. A \(\pi \) is a
                &ldquo;\(\pi \)&rdquo; and not &ldquo;\(3.141\)&rdquo;. Finally,
                \(\mathrm e^{-\mathrm i \pi }\) is &ldquo;\(\mathrm e^{-\mathrm
                i \pi }\)&rdquo;, not &ldquo;\(-1\)&rdquo;, let alone
                &ldquo;-1&rdquo;.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Labels should be legible. They should not only have a
                reasonably large size, they also should not be obscured by lines
                or other text. This also applies to labels of lines and text
                <em>behind</em> the labels.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Labels should be &ldquo;in place&rdquo;. Whenever there
                is enough space, labels should be placed next to the thing they
                label. Only if necessary, add a (subdued) line from the label to
                the labeled object. Try to avoid labels that only reference
                explanations in external legends. Reader have to jump back and
                forth between the explanation and the object that is described.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Consider subduing &ldquo;unimportant&rdquo; labels using,
                for example, a gray color. This will keep the focus on the
                actual graphic.

          <p>
            One of the most frequent kind of graphics, especially in scientific
            papers, are <em>plots</em>. They come in a large variety, including
            simple line plots, parametric plots, three dimensional plots, pie
            charts, and many more.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unfortunately, plots are notoriously hard to get right. Partly, the
            default settings of programs like
            <span class="textsc">gnuplot</span> or Excel are to blame for this
            since these programs make it very convenient to create bad plots.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first question you should ask yourself when creating a plot is:
            Are there enough data points to merit a plot? If the answer is
            &ldquo;not really&rdquo;, use a table.
          </p>

          <p>
            A typical situation where a plot is unnecessary is when people
            present a few numbers in a bar diagram. Here is a real-life example:
            At the end of a seminar a lecturer asked the participants for
            feedback. Of the 50 participants, 30 returned the feedback form.
            According to the feedback, three participants considered the seminar
            &ldquo;very good&rdquo;, nine considered it &ldquo;good&rdquo;, ten
            &ldquo;ok&rdquo;, eight &ldquo;bad&rdquo;, and no one thought that
            the seminar was &ldquo;very bad&rdquo;.
          </p>

          <p>
            A simple way of summing up this information is the following table:
          </p>
          <table>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td class="tdl"><em>Rating given</em></td>

                  <p>
                    <em>Participants (out of 50) who gave this rating</em>
                  </p>
                </td>
                <td class="tdr"><em>Percentage</em></td>

            What the lecturer did was to visualize the data using a 3D bar
            diagram. It looked like this (except that in reality the numbers
            where typeset using some extremely low-resolution bitmap font and
            were near-unreadable):

            Both the table and the &ldquo;plot&rdquo; have about the same size.
            If your first thought is &ldquo;the graphic looks nicer than the
            table&rdquo;, try to answer the following questions based on the
            information in the table or in the graphic:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>1. How many participants were there?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>2. How many participants returned the feedback form?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                3. What percentage of the participants returned the feedback
                form?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>4. How many participants checked &ldquo;very good&rdquo;?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                5. What percentage out of all participants checked &ldquo;very
                good&rdquo;?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                6. Did more than a quarter of the participants check
                &ldquo;bad&rdquo; or &ldquo;very bad&rdquo;?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                7. What percentage of the participants that returned the form
                checked &ldquo;very good&rdquo;?
              </p>

            Sadly, the graphic does not allow us to answer
            <em>a single one of these questions</em>. The table answers all of
            them directly, except for the last one. In essence, the information
            density of the graphic is very close to zero. The table has a much
            higher information density; despite the fact that it uses quite a
            lot of white space to present a few numbers. Here is the list of
            things that went wrong with the 3D-bar diagram:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; The whole graphic is dominated by irritating background
                lines.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; It is not clear what the numbers at the left mean;
                presumably percentages, but it might also be the absolute number
                of participants.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; The labels at the bottom are rotated, making them hard to
                read.
              </p>
              <p>
                (In the real presentation that I saw, the text was rendered at a
                very low resolution with about 10 by 6 pixels per letter with
                wrong kerning, making the rotated text almost impossible to
                read.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; The third dimension adds complexity to the graphic
                without adding information.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; The three dimensional setup makes it much harder to gauge
                the height of the bars correctly. Consider the &ldquo;bad&rdquo;
                bar. Is the number this bar stands for more than 20 or less?
                While the front of the bar is below the 20 line, the back of the
                bar (which counts) is above.

                &bull; It is impossible to tell which numbers are represented by
                the bars. Thus, the bars needlessly hide the information these
                bars are all about.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; What do the bar heights add up to? Is it 100% or 60%?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Does the bar for &ldquo;very bad&rdquo; represent 0
                or&nbsp;1?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>&bull; Why are the bars blue?</p>

          <p>
            You might argue that in the example the exact numbers are not
            important for the graphic. The important things is the
            &ldquo;message&rdquo;, which is that there are more &ldquo;very
            good&rdquo; and &ldquo;good&rdquo; ratings than &ldquo;bad&rdquo;
            and &ldquo;very bad&rdquo;. However, to convey this message either
            use a sentence that says so or use a graphic that conveys this
            message more clearly:

            The above graphic has about the same information density as the
            table (about the same size and the same numbers are shown). In
            addition, one can directly &ldquo;see&rdquo; that there are more
            good or very good ratings than bad ones. One can also
            &ldquo;see&rdquo; that the number of people who gave no rating at
            all is not negligible, which is quite common for feedback forms.

          <p>
            This graphic has been redrawn in <span class="tikzname">TikZ</span>,
            but the original looks almost exactly the same.
          </p>

          <p>
            At first sight, the graphic looks &ldquo;nice and
            informative&rdquo;, but there are a lot of things that went wrong:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; The chart is three dimensional. However, the shadings add
                nothing &ldquo;information-wise&rdquo;, at best, they distract.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; In a 3D-pie-chart the relative sizes are very strongly
                distorted. For example, the area taken up by the gray color of
                &ldquo;Braunkohle&rdquo; is larger than the area taken up by the
                green color of &ldquo;Kernenergie&rdquo;
                <em
                  >despite the fact that the percentage of Braunkohle is less
                  than the percentage of Kernenergie</em
                >.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; The 3D-distortion gets worse for small areas. The area of
                &ldquo;Regenerative&rdquo; somewhat larger than the area of
                &ldquo;Erdgas&rdquo;. The area of &ldquo;Wind&rdquo; is slightly
                smaller than the area of &ldquo;Mineral&ouml;lprodukte&rdquo;
                <em
                  >although the percentage of Wind is nearly three times larger
                  than the percentage of Mineral&ouml;lprodukte.</em
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                In the last case, the different sizes are only partly due to
                distortion. The designer(s) of the original graphic have also
                made the &ldquo;Wind&rdquo; slice too small, even taking
                distortion into account. (Just compare the size of
                &ldquo;Wind&rdquo; to &ldquo;Regenerative&rdquo; in general.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; According to its caption, this chart is supposed to
                inform us that coal was the most important energy source in
                Germany in 2004. Ignoring the strong distortions caused by the
                superfluous and misleading 3D-setup, it takes quite a while for
                this message to get across.
              </p>
              <p>
                Coal as an energy source is split up into two slices: one for
                &ldquo;Steinkohle&rdquo; and one for &ldquo;Braunkohle&rdquo;
                (two different kinds of coal). When you add them up, you see
                that the whole lower half of the pie chart is taken up by coal.
              </p>
              <p>
                The two areas for the different kinds of coal are not visually
                linked at all. Rather, two different colors are used, the labels
                are on different sides of the graphic. By comparison,
                &ldquo;Regenerative&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wind&rdquo; are very
                closely linked.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; The color coding of the graphic follows no logical
                pattern at all. Why is nuclear energy green? Regenerative energy
                is light blue, &ldquo;other sources&rdquo; are blue. It seems
                more like a joke that the area for &ldquo;Braunkohle&rdquo;
                (which literally translates to &ldquo;brown coal&rdquo;) is
                stone gray, while the area for &ldquo;Steinkohle&rdquo; (which
                literally translates to &ldquo;stone coal&rdquo;) is brown.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; The area with the lightest color is used for
                &ldquo;Erdgas&rdquo;. This area stands out most because of the
                brighter color. However, for this chart &ldquo;Erdgas&rdquo; is
                not really important at all.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Edward Tufte calls graphics like the above &ldquo;chart junk&rdquo;.
            (I am happy to announce, however, that <em>Die Zeit</em> has stopped
            using 3D pie charts and their information graphics have got somewhat
            better.)
          </p>

          <p>
            Here are a few recommendations that may help you avoid producing
            chart junk:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>&bull; Do not use 3D pie charts. They are <em>evil</em>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>&bull; Consider using a table instead of a pie chart.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Do not apply colors randomly; use them to direct the
                readers&rsquo;s focus and to group things.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Do not use background patterns, like a crosshatch or
                diagonal lines, instead of colors. They distract. Background
                patterns in information graphics are <em>evil</em>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Pick up your favorite fiction novel and have a look at a typical
            page. You will notice that the page is very uniform. Nothing is
            there to distract the reader while reading; no large headlines, no
            bold text, no large white areas. Indeed, even when the author does
            wish to emphasize something, this is done using italic letters. Such
            letters blend nicely with the main text &ndash; at a distance you
            will not be able to tell whether a page contains italic letters, but
            you would notice a single bold word immediately. The reason novels
            are typeset this way is the following paradigm: Avoid distractions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Good typography (like good organization) is something you do
            <em>not</em> notice. The job of typography is to make reading the
            text, that is, &ldquo;absorbing&rdquo; its information content, as
            effortless as possible. For a novel, readers absorb the content by
            reading the text line-by-line, as if they were listening to someone
            telling the story. In this situation anything on the page that
            distracts the eye from going quickly and evenly from line to line
            will make the text harder to read.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, pick up your favorite weekly magazine or newspaper and have a
            look at a typical page. You will notice that there is quite a lot
            &ldquo;going on&rdquo; on the page. Fonts are used at different
            sizes and in different arrangements, the text is organized in narrow
            columns, typically interleaved with pictures. The reason magazines
            are typeset in this way is another paradigm: Steer attention.
          </p>

          <p>
            Readers will not read a magazine like a novel. Instead of reading a
            magazine line-by-line, we use headlines and short abstracts to check
            whether we want to read a certain article or not. The job of
            typography is to steer our attention to these abstracts and
            headlines, first. Once we have decided that we want to read an
            article, however, we no longer tolerate distractions, which is why
            the main text of articles is typeset exactly the same way as a
            novel.
          </p>

          <p>
            The two principles &ldquo;avoid distractions&rdquo; and &ldquo;steer
            attention&rdquo; also apply to graphics. When you design a graphic,
            you should eliminate everything that will &ldquo;distract the
            eye&rdquo;. At the same time, you should try to actively help the
            reader &ldquo;through the graphic&rdquo; by using fonts/colors/line
            widths to highlight different parts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here is a non-exhaustive list of things that can distract readers:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Strong contrasts will always be registered first by the
                eye. For example, consider the following two grids:
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="lateximagesource" id="lateximage-pgfmanual-140"
                  ><!--
-->
                  <img
                    alt="(-tikz-&nbsp;diagram)"
                    class="lateximage"
                    height="56.355"
                    loading="lazy"
                    src="pgfmanual-images/image-140.png"
                    style
                    width="162.626"
                /></span>
              </p>
              <p>
                Even though the left grid comes first in English reading order,
                the right one is much more likely to be seen first: The
                white-to-black contrast is higher than the gray-to-white
                contrast. In addition, there are more &ldquo;places&rdquo;
                adding to the overall contrast in the right grid.
              </p>
              <p>
                Things like grids and, more generally, help lines usually should
                not grab the attention of the readers and, hence, should be
                typeset with a low contrast to the background. Also, a
                loosely-spaced grid is less distracting than a very
                closely-spaced grid.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Dashed lines create many points at which there is
                black-to-white contrast. Dashed or dotted lines can be very
                distracting and, hence, should be avoided in general.
              </p>
              <p>
                Do not use different dashing patterns to differentiate curves in
                plots. You lose data points this way and the eye is not
                particularly good at &ldquo;grouping things according to a
                dashing pattern&rdquo;. The eye is <em>much</em> better at
                grouping things according to colors.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Background patterns filling an area using diagonal lines
                or horizontal and vertical lines or just dots are almost always
                distracting and, usually, serve no real purpose.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Background images and shadings distract and only seldomly
                add anything of importance to a graphic.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Cute little clip arts can easily draw attention away from
                the data.
